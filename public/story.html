								<p>The group Allies for Gender and Sexuality Inclusion on Grove City College’s campus has been an active presence for LGBTQ+ support and education since the fall of 2016. It began as an attempt by The Table, an LGBTQ+ exclusive group on campus, to involve straight and cisgender students in the conversation on LGBTQ+ topics. That beginning stage with The Table began in the summer of 2016, and Allies became its own organization by the following fall semester. The first meeting was October 5th, and officials were elected October 28th. The first event was a Thanksgiving celebration for students who had a hostile home or no home to return to for the holidays. Since then, Allies has held weekly meetings and several outside events.</p>
								<p>The Spring of 2017, Grove City College announced that Mike Pence, the current Vice President of the United States, would preside as the commencement speaker. Because of his traditionally anti-LGBTQ+ views and his affiliation with Donald Trump’s administration, a group of students rose up to protest this through letters, involvement of alumni, and a physical protest on the day of commencement. Though involvement was offered to the Allies, they declined official involvement, allowing individual members to do as they desire, because of the newness of the group and the desire to build a working relationship with the college before taking action.</p>
								<p>The next development for the group was the battle to become an officially-recognized college organization. This began in the fall of 2017, and brought with it an official rebranding (from Allies to Allies for Gender and Sexuality Inclusion, though still with the shorthand name Allies), a revision of the mission statement, the addition of a Chaplain position, and a plethora of other documents to explain the benefits and complementary nature of Allies to Grove City College’s community and mission. However, after that semester of frequent meetings and complete compliance with the college administration’s requests, in January of 2018 Allies was denied the ability to move on in the process of officiation.</p>
								<p>Now, we are a group of students who continue to meet on a weekly basis to learn about LGBTQ+ topics and support all LGBTQ+ peoples. We are working with other official on-campus groups to host public events, and are still striving to create positive dialogue and atmosphere on this campus for the benefit of all people. As we continue to seek official recognition by Grove City College, we welcome any students who wish to learn more or who desire community in which to safely grow.</p>
