			<h3>Support and educate.</h3>
			<span>The GCC Allies for Gender and Sexuality inclusion is a community open to all students, regardless of identity or belief,  that aims to support our LGBT+ neighbors who may feel isolated and marginalized. Our goals are to create a supportive environment, to educate each other, and to create a space for all students to engage in respectful dialogue and civil discourse, as we do throughout the college. We strongly advocate for showing Godâ€™s unconditional love to each other, as the college encourages in a Christian community.  We do not require members to have a specific worldview, we do not promote any political stance, and we do not endorse one side over another. Our only requirements are respect, compassion, and love, as any group on campus would require. Through our weekly meetings, we will foster educational dialogue and build inclusive community. All of our group activities will adhere to the same motto - Support and Educate.</span>
